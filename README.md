```
# find any open PR touching both filename1 and filename2
Â» splice-graft find_pr owner/repo filename1 filename2

# find a closed or merged PR touching filename1
Â» splice-graft find_pr -s closed -s merged owner/repo filename1

# find a closed or merged PR touching anything under blah/
Â» splice-graft find_pr -s closed -s merged -m re gankra/gankra.github.io '^blah/.*'

# find a PR of any status touching anything under blah/
Â» splice-graft find_pr -s any -m re gankra/gankra.github.io '^blah/.*'
```

### Renaming branches

This tool helps you change the default branch on a bunch of GitHub repos to
`main` or another name. It creates a new branch using the GitHub API and sets
the default branch to it. This tool does not change your client side git
configs and branches, which need to be updated with `git branch -m main` and
`git branch -u origin/main` on your clones.

```bash
$ # Grab an access token with scope 'repos' for your GitHub user account at https://github.com/settings/tokens
$ export GH_ACCESS_TOKEN='abcdef'
$ ./splice_graft.py list > repos.txt
$ # Now, go through the repository list and remove any that you don't want to use
$ ./splice_graft.py fix < repos.txt
```
